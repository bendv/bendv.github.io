Welcome to my site! I am a post-doctoral research at the University of Maryland and I am interested in mapping and monitoring surface water dynamics with multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data. I recently graduated with a PhD from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where I studied forest monitoring using dense Landsat time series and community-based data. I will be updating this site with more content in the near future, but for now, feel free to browse and read more about me and the work that I am involved in.
