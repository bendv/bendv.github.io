Welcome to my site! I am a recent PhD graduate from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where I studied forest monitoring using dense Landsat time series and community-based data.

Check out the some R packages that I have (co-)authored in the past years. Some (all?) are works-in-progress, so any feedback is more than welcome:

* <a href="http://github.com/dutri001/bfastSpatial" target="_blank">bfastSpatial</a>: tools for Landsat and MODIS time series analysis based on the BFAST framework
* <a href="http://github.com/bendv/Rgrowth" target="_blank">Rgrowth</a>: post-disturbance forest regrowth monitoring using Landsat time series
* <a href="http://github.com/bendv/timeSyncR" target="_blank">timeSyncR</a>: an implementation of the <a href="http://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">TimeSync</a> framework for visual interpretation of Landsat time series
* <a href="http://github.com/bendv/bfastPlot" target="_blank">bfastPlot</a>: plotting bfast-type object using <a href="http://ggplot2.org/" target="_blank">ggplot</a>
