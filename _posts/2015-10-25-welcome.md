Welcome to my site! I am a recent PhD graduate from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where I studied forest monitoring using dense Landsat time series and community-based data.

Check out the some R packages that I have (co-)authored in the past years. Some (all?) are works-in-progress, so any feedback is more than welcome:

* [bfastSpatial](http://github.com/dutri001/bfastSpatial): tools for Landsat and MODIS time series analysis based on the BFAST framework
* [Rgrowth](http://github.com/bendv/Rgrowth): post-disturbance forest regrowth monitoring using Landsat time series
* [timeSyncR](http://github.com/bendv/timeSyncR): an implementation of the TimeSync framework for visual interpretation of Landsat time series
* [bfastPlot](http://github.com/bendv/bfastPlot): plotting bfast-type object using [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org/)
