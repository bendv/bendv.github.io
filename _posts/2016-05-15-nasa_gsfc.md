Last Thursday I had the pleasure of giving a talk on my PhD research at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. <!--break-->It was great to be able to hang around, meet the scientists there and get inspired some of the great work they are doing.

The slides I presented are available [here](http://bendevries.ca/nasa_goddard_sfc_talk). I made these using the very cool <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js" target="_blank">reveal.js</a> javascript library (thanks to <a href="http://loicdutrieux.com" target="_blank">Lo&iuml;c Dutrieux</a> for introducing me to it!)
