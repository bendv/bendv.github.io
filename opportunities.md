**Fully Funded M.Sc. positions starting in Fall 2022**

I am looking to recruit two (2) M.Sc. students to start in Fall 2022 to work on research topics related to remote sensing of lakes and wetlands in the Canadian Arctic and the Lake Erie Basin, respectively. Research will make use of various satellite data sources, including (but not necessarily limited to) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Students in their final year of undergraduate studies that meet the departmentâ€™s M.Sc. admission standards and have a background in GIS and remote sensing are encouraged to contact Dr. Ben DeVries (bdv@uoguelph.ca) before submitting an application.

**Note to international applicants:** While I thank all applicants for their interest in these positions, I am only able to provide funding at a domestic level, and am therefore unable to cover international tuition rates.
