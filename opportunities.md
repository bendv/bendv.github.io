The following positions are currently available in my research group:

- <a href="hemlock2021.html">Developing an Eastern Hemlock inventory for Ontario using satellite remote sensing imagery (MSc, Fall 2021)</a>
- <a href="csa2021.html">Monitoring Arctic-Boreal lakes using SWOT Altimetry and SAR remote sensing (PhD, Fall 2021)</a>

I am always keen to speak with students with a background in Remote Sensing and GIS and an interest in topics relating to optical and SAR remote sensing, environmental change and disaster monitoring. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to send me a resume/CV, a brief statement of interest and (unofficial) transcripts.
