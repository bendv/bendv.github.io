**Fully Funded M.Sc. positions starting in Fall 2022**

I am looking to recruit two (2) M.Sc. students to start in September 2022 to work on research topics related to remote sensing of surface water dynamics in the Canadian Arctic and the Lake Erie Basin, respectively. Research will make use of various satellite data sources, including (but not necessarily limited to) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Please consult admission requirements at the Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics (found [here](https://geg.uoguelph.ca/graduate/masters-program)). Interested applicants are encouraged to contact Dr. Ben DeVries (bdv@uoguelph.ca) before submitting an application. 

**Note to international applicants:** While I thank all applicants for their interest in these positions, I am only able to provide funding at a domestic level, and am therefore unable to cover international tuition rates.
