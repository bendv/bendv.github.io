The following positions are currently available in my research group:

- <a href="omafra2020.html">Developing hydrometeorological risk indicators in Southwestern Ontario using remote sensing imagery (MSc starting winter or spring 2021)</a>
- Investigating spatio-temporal trends in wetland inundation and connectivity using satellite SAR and optical data (MSc starting Spring or Fall 2021)
- Characterizing wetland disturbance-recovery dynamics using multi-source satellite data (PhD starting Spring or Fall 2021)

I am always keen to speak with students with a background in Remote Sensing and GIS and an interest in topics relating to optical and SAR remote sensing, environmental change and disaster monitoring. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to send me a resume/CV, a brief statement of interest and (unofficial) transcripts.
