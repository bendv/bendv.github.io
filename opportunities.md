**Stay tuned for MSc/PhD opportunities in my research group starting in September 2022**

I am always keen to speak with students with a background in Remote Sensing and GIS and an interest in topics relating to optical and SAR remote sensing, environmental change and disaster monitoring. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to send me a resume/CV, a brief statement of interest and (unofficial) transcripts.
