<h1>Assistant Research Professor</h1>
<h2>Remote Sensing of Environmental Change</h2>
	
<p>I am an Assistant Research Professor at the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland. My research interests include the application of satellite Earth Observation data to answer questions related to ecosystem dynamics, resilience, and impacts of land use and land cover change.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD and MSc degrees from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. My PhD research (2011-2015) was concerned with human impacts in tropical forests. During my MSc (2009-2010), I studied the influence of hydrology on carbon emissions in drained and restored peatlands in the tropics.</p>

<p>On this site you can find more information on my <a href="research.html">research interests</a>, <a href="/publications/">publications</a> and <a href="/resources/">research tools</a> I have developed. If you have any questions or are interested in potential collaborations, please contact me at <a href="mailto:bdv@umd.edu">bdv@umd.edu</a>.</p>
