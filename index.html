<h1>Research Scientist</h1>
<h2>Remote Sensing of Ecosystem Dynamics</h2>
	
<p>I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland, where I am developing algorithms to track changes in inundation and water quality in wetland and lake ecosystems. My research interests include the application of remote sensing data and methods to answer questions related to ecosystem dynamics, resilience, and impacts of land use and land cover change.</p>

<p>I previously earned a PhD and MSc from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. My PhD research (2011-2015) was concerned with human impacts in tropical forests. During my MSc (2009-2010), I studied the influence of hydrology on carbon emissions in drained and restored peatlands in the tropics.</p>
