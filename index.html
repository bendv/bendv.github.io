<h1>Post-Doctoral Research Associate</h1>
<h2>Remote Sensing of Land Cover Change and Ecosystem Dynamics</h2>
	
<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland, where I am developing algorithms to track changes in inundation and water quality in wetland and lake ecosystems. My research interests include the application of remote sensing data and methods to answer questions related to land use and land cover change, ecosystem dynamics and resilience.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD (2015) and MSc (2010) from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. My PhD research was concerned with the use of dense Landsat time series to track human impacts in tropical forests. During my MSc, I studied the influence of sub-surface hydrology on carbon emissions in drained and restored peatlands in the tropics.</p>
