	<p>I am a remote sensing scientist interested in monitoring land cover change dynamics using a variety of data sources, including optical, radar and in situ data. I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland. My research interests involve mapping and monitoring surface water inundation at high temporal resolution using multi-sensor data.</p>

	<p>I completed and defended my PhD at Wageningen University in the Netherlands in October 2015. My thesis was entitled "Monitoring tropical forest dynamics using Landsat time series and community-based data" and is available for download <a href="http://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2112.8409" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
