<h2>Wetland inundation dynamics</h2>

<p>Monitoring surface inundation in wetlands is important for understanding the ecosystem services they offer, including the regulation of regional hydrology, water quality and greenhouse gas cycling. Existing methods for detecting wetland inundation using satellite imagery are often inadequate due to the complexity of wetlands in both space and time. Surface water in wetlands is often mixed with vegetation or soils, giving rise to mixed pixels and significant omissions in inundation map products. Additionally, inundation is highly dynamic in most wetland systems and require regular satellite observations to capture their rapid changes. <strong>Figure&nbsp;1</strong> shows the importance of accounting for mixed water pixels when mapping wetland inundation using Landsat imagery. Including only open water (ie. no mixed vegetation or soil) in our inundation map results in a large underestimate in inundated area. </p>

<p>Funded by NASA's <a href="http://lcluc.umd.edu/">Land Cover and Land Use Change (LCLUC)</a> programme, my research involves the monitoring of surface water inundation at the sub-pixel level using Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, combined with Sentinel-1 SAR, towards establishing a near-daily record of inundation over much of North America.

<h2>Tropical forest change</h2>

<p>My PhD dissertation describes novel approaches to monitoring change dynamics in tropical forests. New methods are necessary for helping countries in the tropics to advance their monitoring efforts towards initiatives like the UN's Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) programme. In my research, I explored ways in which time series of Landsat data can be used to monitor deforestation, degradation and regrowth. <strong>Figure&nbsp;2</strong> shows an example of the <a href="http://www.wur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Geo-information-Science-and-Remote-Sensing/Research/Integrated-land-monitoring/Change_detection_and_monitoring.htm">bfastmonitor</a> method over a site in southern Ethiopia. In <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.02.012">this study</a>, I showed that by using all Landsat observations, small-scale deforestation could be tracked fairly well. Without reliable ground-based observations, however, degradation was nearly impossible to track. By partnering with local communities, I showed in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147121">another study</a> that high-detail characterization of deforestation and degradation in these complex forest systems is indeed possible with dense Landsat time series.</p>

<p>In addition to my work in southern Ethiopia, I published another of my <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.020">PhD chapters</a> describing a method for the automated detection of post-disturbance regrowth using Landsat time series. I demonstrated the method in Madre de Dios, southern Peru, an area characterized by rapid forest change in recent years due to conversion to pasture and small-scale gold mining operations.</p>

<h2>Change monitoring resources</h2>

<p>Developing open-source tools is an important part of my work. Alongside my research activities, I have produced or collaborated on a number of open-source packages. You can read more about them <a href="/resources/">here</a>.</p>
