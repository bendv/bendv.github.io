## Teaching Experience

### Geoscripting (GRS-33806)
*Masters in Geo-Information, Wageningen University*. This course covers concepts and tools in scripting to deal with vector and raster data, spatial data, such as satellite imagery used in remote sensing studies. The focus of the course is on the use of R, python and open source libraries in spatial data analysis. As *teaching assistant*, I authored several modules related to raster data processing, classification and time series analysis, gave lectures and supervised practical sessions and students' independent projects.  
* [course website](https://ssc.wur.nl/Studiegids/Vak/GRS-33806)  
* [course materials](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/).

### Advanced Earth Observation (GRS-32306)
*Masters in Geo-Information, Wageningen University*. This course builds upon fundamental concepts covers concepts such as: physical principles in optical remote sensing, radiative transfer modelling, image processing, LiDAR, hyperspectral remote sensing, time series anlaysis, land cover and land cover change mapping. As *teaching assistant*, I was responsible for overseeing practical sessions, where students were given assignments applying theory learned in lectures.  
* [course website](https://ssc.wur.nl/Studiegids/Vak/GRS-32306)  

### Remote Sensing and GIS Integration (GRS-60312)
*Masters in Geo-Information, Wageningen University*. This course is comprised of a group project using GIS and remote sensing data and methods to solve real-world problems. As *guest lecturer*, I introduced students to novel approaches in integrating remote sensing time series data with participatory monitoring or "citizen science" data to improve upon satellite-based methods, using my work in southwestern Ethiopia as a case study.  
* [course website](https://ssc.wur.nl/Studiegids/Vak/GRS-60312)

### Other training activities
* Designed and held training workshops with staff of the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture in southwestern Ethiopia, covering forests and climate change, ecosystem services, forest inventory methods and forest change monitoring (2011-2014).
* Designed and held a 1-week training workshop with WWF field staff in Palangkaraya, Indonesia, cover hydrological modeling and carbon accounting in tropical peatlands. (August 2010).
* Private tutor for secondary school students in Toronto, Ontario, focussing on pre-university calculus, algebra, chemistry and biology (2003-2007).
* Other spatial data tools and tutorials [available online](../resources).
